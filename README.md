# Next_Word_Recommendation
I used a text document from google for train my model 
It is very time consuming for train the model . Since i didn't used the concept of Transfer learning.
Used the Natural language processing techniques in this project.
Created a new function for predicting the new upcoming Sentence's next word.
And i saved my prediction model as well as tokenizer model using pickle,joblib etc.You guys can see my notebooks and just understand the concepts.Actually it is a LSTM
neural network project , for training i used LSTM,Dense,Embedded and neural networks in deep learning.so just enjoy guys and explore your data science life.
