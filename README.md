# Next_Word_Recommendation
I used a text document from Google for train my model. It is very time-consuming to train the model. Since I didn't use the concept of transfer learning. Used natural language processing techniques in this project. Created a new function for predicting the new upcoming sentence. And I saved my prediction model as well as tokenizer model using Pickle, JobLib, etc. You guys can see my notebooks and just understand the concepts.Actually, it is a LSTM neural network project; for training, I used LSTM, dense Embedded neural networks in deep learning.so just enjoy guys and explore your data science life.
